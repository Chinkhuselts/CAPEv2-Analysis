WannaCry ransomware reveals a Windows PE32 executable exhibiting typical ransomware behavior, including encrypting user files with a .wncry extension, dropping a ransom note named @WannaDecryptor@.txt, and deleting shadow copies to prevent recovery. It modifies the registry to maintain persistence, creates a mutex to avoid reinfection, and spawns processes like wmic.exe to disable security software. Network activity shows attempts to contact known command-and-control servers and exploit SMB vulnerabilities (EternalBlue) for lateral movement. Static analysis highlights cryptographic and networking API usage alongside embedded ransom messages and wallet addresses, confirming the sampleâ€™s identity as WannaCry.
